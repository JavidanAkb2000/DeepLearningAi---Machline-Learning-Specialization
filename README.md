# 🎓 Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification (DeepLearning.AI - Andrew Ng)

Welcome to my learning repository for the first course in the Machine Learning Specialization by **DeepLearning.AI & Andrew Ng**.

This folder contains my **code, notes, and implementations** for the course titled:

> **“Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification”**

---

## 📘 What This Course Covers

This course is focused on **supervised learning**, specifically:
- Regression (predicting continuous values)
- Classification (predicting binary class labels)

I implemented everything from scratch using **NumPy and Python**, including:
- Model logic
- Gradient descent
- Cost functions
- Regularization
- Prediction and evaluation

No libraries like scikit-learn were used — this is pure ML logic and math.

## 🧠 Key Concepts I Learned

### 🔹 Linear Regression
- What it models and when to use it
- Cost function (Mean Squared Error)
- How gradient descent adjusts weights to minimize error
- Why it's useful for continuous prediction tasks

### 🔹 Logistic Regression
- How it extends linear regression using the **sigmoid function**
- How to model **probabilities** and make **binary predictions**
- Why **Log Loss (Cross-Entropy)** works better than MSE for classification

### 🔹 Gradient Descent
- Manually implemented from scratch
- Understood how weights are updated using partial derivatives
- Explored how learning rate affects convergence

### 🔹 Regularization (L2)
- Added a penalty term to prevent overfitting
- Implemented regularized cost and gradient functions
- Understood how the **λ (lambda)** term balances model complexity

### 🔹 Evaluation
- Predicted using thresholds (≥ 0.5 → class 1)
- Measured model performance using **accuracy**
- Understood overfitting vs underfitting behavior

## ✅ Certificate

I’ve completed the course and received the certificate officially from DeepLearning.AI.  
This repo is a reflection of the effort I’ve put in to **understand every component of ML from scratch**, not just complete quizzes.

## 🧠 Next Steps

I’m continuing the specialization and working toward:
- Multiclass classification
- Decision trees
- Neural networks
- Practical applications and deployment

Feel free to explore the code, fork the repo, or reach out if you're learning ML too!
